# ChatServer
This is a basic chat server, the server is ran by executing the file chatRoom.java. A user connects to server by running the command java ChatScreen localhost <username> on the command line. A user can type a message and hit send, to send a message to all other users that are connected to the server. A user disconnects by hitting exit.
 
I chose this program to demonstrate an example of my work completed in a group setting and an understanding of the way a computer system interacts with a network by creating a server, and allowing clients to connect to it. I thought this project would nicely represent my programming because I thought the versatility of it is impressive in that it can be run anywhere and be connected to by other users running different protocols. This program is a great example of concurrent programming by means of utilizing an executor thread pool. I think that using the thread pool and doing socket programming demonstrates concepts pertinant to most modern applications, so I thought this program would be a good way to demonstrate experience in multithreaded programming.

I liked that we were allowed some creativity in this project as we were able to define our own network protocol and implement it. Coordinating develpoment of this project definitely took lots of communication while working in our group, and a difficult program like this, completed as a group, likely help all of our understanding in that we were often explaining difficult concepts to one another. This program also implements the runnable interface which is widely used. Between demonstrating implementing an interface, socket programming experience, and concurrent programming experience, this project included a few different highly relevant technologies. Additionally, there were key elements of software design exercised in designing a protocol that would be dynamic, minimalistic, and efficent.
